# Global Spotify Streaming Trends Dashboard

This project provides an end-to-end analysis of music popularity trends using a dataset of daily charts from Spotify. The goal was to uncover key insights into what drives a song's popularity, whether it's related to its audio features or broader market and temporal factors.

The analysis was conducted in Python using libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. The key findings were then visualized on an interactive dashboard created with **Tableau Public**.
