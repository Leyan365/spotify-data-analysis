Global Spotify Streaming Trends Dashboard
Project Description
This project provides an end-to-end analysis of music popularity trends using a dataset of daily charts from Spotify. The goal was to uncover key insights into what drives a song's popularity, whether it's related to its audio features or broader market and temporal factors.

The analysis was conducted in Python using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The key findings were then visualized on an interactive dashboard created with Tableau Public.




Final Dashboard
The interactive dashboard is available to explore on Tableau Public.
